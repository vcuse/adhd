# ADHD & Virtual Reality
Staying focused while studying is especially challenging for students with ADHD. In partnership with Dr. Joshua Langberg from VCU Psychology and Jason Bennett from VCU Arts, our lab is implementing a prototype in virtual reality to support students with ADHD. More about this project will be posted soon.
